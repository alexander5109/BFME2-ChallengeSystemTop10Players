**Original: 2019**

Johannes Gerril 
1. A player can challenge up to four ranks above himself, where the challenger will take his spot if he wins. For example, rank 6 can challenge rank 5, 4, 3 and 2 for their spots.
2. The players will play best of 9. But in case of mutual consent, the games can consist on 4 games as 1vs1, 4 games as 2vs2, and a final tie-breaker if necesary, as 1vs1.
3. Players must play their games at an agreed time. If one player does not show up to play on that date and ignores the challenge, they lose 0-8 in 1v1. 2v2 should be played within a week whenever all players are online.
If a player's teammate does not login within the allotted week, they will be assigned a trusty medium dwarf AI to play their games or they must find a new partner for their games.
4. A player cannot challenge another player who is currently being challenged/challenging someone else until the matches are finished.
5. Players can decide if they want a neutral host or not. If both do not agree with each other, a neutral host must be used.
6. It's not allowed to pick faction.
7. Maps can be any if players agree. Default maps are Westfold, West Emnet and Fords of Isen 2 (any skin).
8. Challenges should be posted in discord under the tournament section.
9. You can only challenge the same player max 2 times within 2 weeks. An exception can be made for 2nd challenging 1st, if 1st accept more than two challenges.
10. Players who are not on the list can challenge rank 10, 9, 8 and 7. I will make sure players who are not on the list are worthy (test game with me if needed).
11. All games should be saved.
12. DC Rules: If a neutral host DC and the players keep playing (no matter who get's the host) the end result of the game is locked. If someone DC in 2v2 and his teammate keep playing the end result of the game is locked. Players can save the replay if they believe they had significant advantage when the DC occured (atleast 70-30). This can obviously only be used if the game isn't played to the end.

*About Skill Tier Roles*

1• Novice: Full on noob (keep in mind, some people with the Novice role just haven't been evaluated).
2• Apprentice: Learning the ropes of playing.
3• Adept: Generally good player.
4• Challenger: You're worthy to challenge players on the top 10 list.
5• Expert: Serious skilled player.
6• Elite: Especially skilled.
7• Super Elite: Considered a pro.
8• Master: Mastering the game.
9• GrandMaster: Extremely dangerous, proceed with caution.
10• Dominator: The player who dominates 1v1 and/or 2v2.
11• GOAT: Greatest of all time - keep the 1st spot for 1 year.

These roles can be acquired by having your player performance assessed by a mod with a role at least 2 levels above your own (except in the case of Master, which can be assigned by any mod with the Master role). Some general things we look for are:

• Micro Management.
• Macro Management.
• Resource Management.
• Map Awareness.
• Teamwork.
• Panic level

Update: March 2 2021
Challenge Rules

1. A player can challenge up to 4 (four) ranks above himself, and if he wins he gains the spot from the player he just defeated. For example, rank 10 can challenge rank 9, 8, 7 and 6 for their spots. 
Players can arrange challenge games against players on 5(five) or more ranks above, but it entirely relies on the top players consent. Nobody is obligated to accept challenges from anyone beneath the 4(four) ranks. Challenge is valid but "dodgeable".

2. Players with the “Skill Tier: 4 Challenger” role or above can begin challenging the last 4 ranks of the top10 list.

3. Challenges should be posted in Discord in the respective “top10-challenging” tab, informing the respective player that he’s being challenged. Challenged player has 48 hours to answer and arrange a playdate. If a top 10 player ignores the challenge, the player who challenged him takes his spot and the event is logged as a loss for the dodger.

4. Players must play their games in agreed time and have 3 days to complete all games. If one player does not show up to play on the date they arranged in discord, it is considered as a loss for him.
5. The players will play best of 9. But in case of mutual consent, the games can consist of 4 games as 1vs1, 4 games as 2vs2, and a final tie-breaker if necessary, as 1vs1.

6. In case of 2vs2, all games should be played in a neutral host no matter what. Players shall find another 2 players and turn each other to play with them in order to complete the 2v2 games.

7. A player cannot challenge another player who is currently being challenged/challenging someone else until the matches are finished.

8. For the 1vs1 games, it is preferable that all games are in neutral host. But in case it is not possible, both players can agree to play their own hosts in order to avoid delaying the games.
9. It's not allowed to pick a faction.

10. Each player shall pick a map per game. Maps can be any from the 1.09 map list as long it’s not a fortress or mission map and both players agree. In case of disputes, these are the default maps.
*1vs1 maps are Westfold, Firien Dale, West Emnet, Lossarnach, Chetwood, Hollin II, Ford of Bruinen, Fords of Isen 2 (any skin). 
*2vs2 maps are Lebennin, Firien Forest, Eryn Rhun, Crossroads, Upper Anduin, South Hollin, Udun, (any skin)

11. You can only challenge the same player max 2 times within 15 days. The second challenge can be done after 24 hours since the last challenge, unless the challenged player accepts to play earlier than this. A third challenge can also be done against the same player but it entirely relies on the challenged player's consent, as he’s free to dodge after he has accepted it twice.

12. DC Rules: If a neutral host DC and the players keep playing (no matter who gets the host) the end result of the game is locked, so please exit the game if the neutral host left. 
If someone DC in 2v2 and his teammate keep playing the end result of the game is locked, once again, leave the game if this occurs. 
Players can save the replay if they believe they had a significant advantage when the DC occured (at least 70-30). Then the replay will be considered as the usual unfinished game in dispuse, which will be up to admins to decide if there was any winner.
13. Every replay (loses and wins) shall be saved and, if possible, uploaded in Gamereplays.org with the name "Challenge #: Player vs Player"
Link: https://www.gamereplays.org/battleformiddleearth2/replays.php?game=50&show=event&id=1380

14. If the challenging players have clan wars accounts, games shall also be reported in the clanwars.cc league. Players are responsable for getting their games autoreported and ensuring the nicknames match with cw.cc roster as the site rules indicate.

Aule_Ecthelion
By far the most overrated player who ever grace the confines of BFME 2. His presence in lobby or rather lack of presence has always been looked at with disgust. Him selfishly going AFK for hours, not reporting cw games or dodging after 2-0 only states the egotistical human being he is. While it's impossible to play a game without him lagging the whole game, making the gaming experience insufferable for everyone else, he is ironically the only one constantly complaining about lag and command fails, obviously used as an cheap excuse for his poor performance. Not the least the fact that he find Blade Runner 2049 boring and bad, just exposes his lack of philosophical depth and intellect. With a humiliating defeat of 12-30 against Sauron in the challenges, Aule_Ecthelion has offically become Sauron's personal bitch.
Him being an incompetent clanwars admin with strong biases and having a tendency to only buff his favorite factions when he adjust the balance in BETA - is nothing compared to the fact that he doesn't give shit about logical consistency in his moral believes. While Aule_Ecthelion has some redeeming qualities as a player it is by far overshadowed by his abominable character. We will all look upon the day where Aule_Ecthelion either get grinded up alive in a commercially designed macerator or getting exposure to high concentrations of carbon dioxide gas 'burn from the inside out' so he can experience the same faith as his non-human-animal victims.

"old"

In the past he was known as the black sheep in 2v2, but has developed into one of the strongest teammates you can get.

 Random/Randy (dU)
 Not only is he great player but also a excellent trainer. His skill, knowledge and personality have gained him a lot respect in the community.
 
 
 

SAURON
There in the dark, gazing faintly at the twisting shadows of his lair, lied a truly barbarous individual, whose deranged nature and disheveled appearance caught the curiosity of the whimsical Bunito, whose adventures have led him into this dark cave. "Sauron... Sauron...Sauron..." the figure endlessly mumbled to itself, presumptuously its own name, could be seen staring into a small screen. Bunito had seen this behavior before, and recognized the source as belonging to 1.00, a patch whose player-base either hasn't figured out how to patch their game, is playing on gameranger for the first time, or has self proclaimed their ultra-hard-pro nature, usually after the discovery that Fellbeasts destroy fortresses and Spider Rider's bows have been blessed by Apollo himself, the Olympian deity of archery. With a lighthearted grin, Bunito installed 1.09 onto the Canadian's laptop, instilling a curiosity that would grow, allowing him to break free from Plato's cave and overcome his Turkish compadres in battle. As the clouds parted and sunlight shone on Bunito's path later that day, Sauron could be seen in the open, having been burned by the fire of 1.09 that was placed in his heart, thereby becoming one of the el classico beta boys.

 
SAURON
Sauron used to be the typical self proclaimed "ultra-hard-pro" player from 1.00. Category which by the way is also self proclaimed by 70% of their players once they learn Fellbeasts destroy fortresses, while other 30% are players who are using GameRanger for first time. 
This canadian boy didn't necessarily reach the top of his skill on 1.00, but one day he grew a itch of curiosity. Months later he managed to escape from the Plato's Cave and started to play 1.09. He learned a couple a things and inmediatly he was able to overcome his 1.00 compadres. Time later, Aule_Ecthelion, during his adventures on 1.00, somehow kidnaped Sauron. And since then, he's one of the classic beta boy.

Challenge Rules
Rule 1.
A player can challenge up to 4 (four) ranks above himself. If if he wins the match, he gains the spot from the player he just defeated.
Players outside the top 10 list with the “Skill Tier: 4 Skilled” role are considered rank 11 players, so they can challenge the ranks 10, 9, 8 and 7.
Rule 2.
As a exception on first rule, players can arrange challenge games against players on 5(five) or more ranks above, but it entirely relies on the top players consent. Nobody is obligated to accept challenges from anyone beneath the 4(four) ranks. Challenge is valid but "dodgeable".
If the challenging player is someone from outside the top10 list, no wins or loses will be scored.
Rule 3.
Challenges have to be issued through this Discord.
Players should post in the ":speech_balloon:・challenging" tab who they want to challenge.
Please refrain from posting anything unrelated; use the channels ":banana:・mess-hall" or ":speech_balloon:・general instead."
Rule 4.
A top 10 player has 48 hours to accept a challenge in the respective discord tab, then both players have a week to play their games at an agreed time.
If a top 10 player does not show up at the agreed time, refuses to play, or is simply inactive, he will lose his spot and the challenging player will take it. Yet, no wins or loses will be scored.
Rule 5.
Game results shall be posted on discord attaching a .rar or .zip with all the replays. If possible, upload the best replay of the encounter in Gamereplays.org 1.09 Replays Section with the name "Challenge #: Player vs Player".
Rule 6.
If the challenging players have clan wars accounts, games shall also be reported in the clanwars.cc league. Players are responsable for getting their games autoreported and ensuring the nicknames match with cw.cc roster as the site rules indicate.
Rule 7.
A challenge encounter can be played in two ways. It will be a matter of both players consent to decide how to play it.
A: As a simple best of 9(nine) games in 1vs1.
B: As 4(four) games in 1vs1, 4(four) games as 2vs2, and a final tie-breaker if necessary, as 1(one) 1vs1.
Rule 8.
Two players can play each other(doesn't count challenges without replays) a max of 2(two) times within 15(fifteen) days.
If the first challenge score was 5-4, the second challenge can be issued after 2 days. If 5-3 or 5-2, after 7 days. And finally, if 5-1 or 5-0, after 14 days.
Players can play the 2nd challenge early than this if the challenged player accepts to do it. But he's not obligated to respond a challenge outside this ranges of time. Challenge is valid but "dodgeable".
Rule 9.
A player cannot challenge another player who is currently being challenged/challenging someone else until the matches are finished and the ranking updated.
Rule 10.
It's not allowed to pick a faction.
Rule 11.
Each player shall pick a map per game. Maps can be any from the 1.09 map list as long it’s not a fortress or mission map and both players agree. In case of disputes, these are the default maps.
*1vs1 maps are Westfold, Firien Dale, West Emnet, Lossarnach, Chetwood, Hollin II, Ford of Bruinen, Fords of Isen 2 (any skin).
*2vs2 maps are Lebennin, Firien Forest, Eryn Rhun, Crossroads, Upper Anduin, South Hollin, Udun, (any skin)
Rule 12.
The 1vs1 games can preferentially be played in a neutral host. But in case it is not possible, both players can agree to play their own hosts in order to avoid delaying the games.
Rule 13.
The 2vs2 games should always be played on a neutral host. Players will have to find another 2 players and turn each other to play with them in order to complete the 2v2 games.
Rule 14.
If the neutral host DC's, then players can choose to continue playing or exit the match. If the game is completed, the result is final. Players may also choose to leave the match in the case that the neutral host or a teammate disconnects - a cucumba specialist will decide if the game has 70-30 advantage, otherwise the game will be replayed.

You can download the game there for free without any strange links in between. \nIf you have any existing DVD copy of this game you can also use it and avoid. \n However, you will need to download Ecth's Patch Switcher to be able to play the latest versions we continue to develop (latest was released in 2024) \n\n*Option 2 is a entire project that became a All in One application which allows you to download and install any BFME game.
